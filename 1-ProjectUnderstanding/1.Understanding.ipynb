The second purpose of doing this challange is organize a base project on the CRISP-DM model for more complex projects on future."

A data directory will be created on the main folder, and the data will be dowloaded into the directory. The data contains 418 entrys for the test and 891 for training. Maybe can have miss values on the columns and possible the data needs some processing. A further study will be conducted before implementation of the model."
